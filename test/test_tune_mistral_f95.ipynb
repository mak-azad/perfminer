The messages should clearly indicate an enhancement that makes the code more efficient, use less memory, or more efficiently utilize system resources. Also, if a commit message describes a change made to address a performance bottleneck, prevent performance degradation, or solve a problem that negatively affects performance. This includes optimizations like replacing inefficient code patterns that are known to kill performance even if the message does not use the word 'improvement' explicitly.\n",

Additionally, pay close attention to the context in which terms like 'improvements' are used. Not all improvements are related to performance—only, classify a message as 'Yes' if it specifically mentions enhancements related to execution time, memory usage, or resource efficiency.
